# Exact Change

## Goal

Develop a game in which you are tasked to find the exact change, in coins, for a random sum.

## Notes

In the **res** folder you find the SVG illustration I created for the project. In the **Illustration** folder you actually find the graphic I'd like to use in the header, as to introduce the project. In the **Loader** folder instead, you find what I believe to be a rather nifty loading animation, using a series of nested `g` elements.
