# React Podcast App

<!-- Link to the proud (and live!) result [right here on codepen]() -->

## Preface

For the second project in my practice-with-react series, I want to create a simple podcast application, drawing data in from an RSS feed to display information regarding the freeCodeCamp podcast and allow visitors to listen to a specific episode.

In so doing, I plan to practice with:

- react;

- styled components.

In terms of design patterns, I intend to implement a "skeleton" of the content which is to be displayed, before the content is actually displayed. Something which was heavily discussed for one of the codepen challenges of October.

In terms of user stories, as to draw inspiration from freeCodeCamp itself:

- as the page loads, I am welcomed by the podcast application with the latest episodes for freeCodeCamp. I am able to relate to this with a simple image, the title, a brief description and an audio player.

- as I hit the play button, the audio should play.

- I am able to change the position of the audio;

- I am able to change the speed of the audio;

- I am able to change the volume.

In terms of design, I'd like to stretch the application to cover the entirety of the page for viewports smaller than an arbitrary size. On larger devices, I'd like to have the information for the episode on the right, with the left section displaying the image for the podcast.

But that ought to be enough of a plan. Going to work.
