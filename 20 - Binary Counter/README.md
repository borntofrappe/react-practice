# Binary Counter

## Goal

Count in binary using a series of light bulbs.

## Notes

This project was inspired by [this pen](https://codepen.io/RockStarwind/pen/NWPLeQq), but most prominently from the representation of binary code presented in the [CS50 introductory course to software](https://youtu.be/jjqgP9dpD1k?t) to software. It is thoroughly and delightfully explained [roughly at this timestamp](https://youtu.be/jjqgP9dpD1k?t=509).
