# Binary Counter

## Goal

Count in binary using a series of light bulbs.

## Notes

This project was inspired by [this pen](https://codepen.io/RockStarwind/pen/NWPLeQq), but most prominently from the representation of binary code presented in the [CS50 introductory course to software](https://youtu.be/jjqgP9dpD1k?t) to software. It is thoroughly and delightfully explained [roughly at this timestamp](https://youtu.be/jjqgP9dpD1k?t=509).

In the **res** folder you find the graphic for the light bulb used throughout the project. The idea is to change the color of the bulb, but also add the dashes all around the shape to signal whether or not a specific light bulb has been lit.
