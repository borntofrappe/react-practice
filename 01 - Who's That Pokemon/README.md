# Who's That Pokemon?

Link to the work-in-progress right [here](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/GwYLRw).

Inspired by [this pen](https://codepen.io/tiffachoo/pen/KGJEba) highlighted in the latest spark on codepen, the first project in the 30+ efforts with React tries to replicate the feature showcased every episode of the Pokemon anime. The quiz is deceptively simple: you are presented with the shadow of a pokemon, you then input your answer and are displayed the correct match.

It is a good way to practice with basic styling and rather simple animation.
