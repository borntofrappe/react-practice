# showcase

_Please note:_ the concept for this project was first developed in [this demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/NELLxG/).

The goal is to create a basic application to showcase the demos built in this repository.

The design is blatantly inspired by [codevember's own website](http://codevember.xyz/).

## Design

In the `res` folder I dedicate small projects to the design of important elements, like the animation in the background of the main heading.
