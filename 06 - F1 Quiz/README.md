# React F1 Quiz

## Preface

The goal of this project is to replicate the quiz proposed each race week on the F1 official website. For reference and for the latest quiz at the time of writing, see [this page](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.quiz-put-your-chinese-grand-prix-knowledge-to-the-test-2019.dUcW90JWJSAw9xhf75LSJ.html).

A good pretext to practice with React and perhaps a tad of CSS and SVG, for transitions and a couple of icons respectively.

## UI

The application is immediately designed in vanilla HTML and CSS.

- in **Quiz Intro** the first page introducing the quiz is crafted with a sample image and a giant bold button;

- in **Quiz Query** the structure highlighting the actual quiz is designed. I tried to add comments to the different portions, but the overlap between the two must be carefully considered).
