# Books by Title âš›

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/JgWdZd)

## Goal

Fetch books from the openlibrary API and display them through SVG elements.

## Notes

This is a refactor of a previous entry for the #codepenchallenge. You can find the project [here on codepen](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/pMNOaa) or locally in the **Vanilla JS** folder.

I decided to replicate the concept with React as to practice with a recent addition to the framework, and one I've picked up following a workshop: react hooks. In the project at hand, I make use of `useState` and `useRef` specifically, to create a functioning application without class components.
