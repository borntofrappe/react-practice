# Books by Title âš›

<!-- ## [Live Demo]() -->

## Goal

Fetch books from the openlibrary API and display them through SVG elements.

## Notes

This is a refactor of a previous entry for the #codepenchallenge. You can find the project [here on codepen](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/pMNOaa) or locally in the **Vanilla JS** folder.

I decided to replicate the concept with the React as to practice with a few modern features of the framework, namely hooks and lazy loading.
