# Surf World Cups

## Goal

Highlight the number of championship won by countries and through an area chart.

## Notes

With this visualization I try to incorporate the area chart with the overall theme of the data. Moreover, I try to rely on a rarely-used CSS property in `shape-outside`, to position the text explaining the visualization right next to the viz itself.

In the **res** folder you find a first attempt for the desired design. The script is also responsible for massaging the data and rendering the area chart through the `d3` library itself. You also find a few SVG icons created for the project, in order to display the countries visually.
