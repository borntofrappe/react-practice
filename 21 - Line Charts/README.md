# Line Charts

This project allows me to practice with React, D3 and specifically the concept of _data join_. One of the most pernicious aspects of D3 is the enter-update-exit pattern. [selection.join](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#selection_join) promises a more robust approach by specifying what happens to new, existing, old elements in a single function.

## Resources

I'll try developing the project on my own, but the following will certainly help.

- [Joining Data](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#joining-data)

- [selection.join](https://observablehq.com/@d3/selection-join)

- [Thinking with Joins](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/join/)
