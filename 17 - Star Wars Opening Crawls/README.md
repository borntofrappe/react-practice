# [Star Wars Opening Crawls](https://4p7l5.codesandbox.io/)

## Goal

Fetch data from the Star Wars API and animate the opening crawls for a selected movie with React Spring.

## Notes

The project is meant to be introduced by a loading screen. In the **res** folder you find an idea of how this screen should look like. I've used anime.js to animate the SVG syntax, but React Spring should be able to achieve the same result.
