# Surf World Cups

## Goal

Highlight the number of championship won by countries with a generative data viz.

## Notes

In a first attempt without using any framework, I tried to highlight the championships won by each country with an area chart. You can find this effort in the **res** folder.

Moving toward a more generative data viz approach, I decided to remove the rather predictable design and instead use an SVG path developed for the dataset in use.
