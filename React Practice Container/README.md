# React Practice Container

<!-- Link to the work-in-progress pen right [here](). -->

## Preface

With this first project, which does not count toward the 30+ tally of React based projects, I set out to create a container for future efforts. Meaning a hub, a landing page which will collect every new React project I will create.

Blatantly inspired by codevember's own website.
