# Reactice

## Brief

Inspired by many, but mostly [codevember](http://codevember.xyz/) and Wes Bos's course [javascript 30](https://javascript30.com/), I set out to create 30 applications with React.js. 31 for good measure.

Each application will be saved in a separate folder of this very own repository. Perhaps rather predictably, each application will also be included, cased in the grid-based layout provided by the very first project. This one will be used akin to an advent calendar, and will likely motivate me enough to build something. And then something else, for thirty more times.

More is detailed in the **about** section of the first project.
