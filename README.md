# Reactice

> (react, practice) => reactice

## TODO

- [ ] rewrite README in light of extended hiatus, setting a new direction for the repo

- [ ] revisit project **#01 - Who's That Pokemon** to cover the existing bug

## Brief

Inspired by many, but mostly [codevember](http://codevember.xyz/) and Wes Bos's course [javascript 30](https://javascript30.com/), I set out to create 30 applications with React.js. 31 for good measure.

Each application will be saved in a separate folder of this very own repository. Upon completing the last project of the lot, I will update the grid-based layout referenced in the **React Practice Container** folder, showcasing each one of them.

## Short List

### Reactice Container

Cased [right here](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/NELLxG/).

A stylish container in which to reference every single future react-based project which is part of #reactice. Using:

- styled-components;

- react-router.

### 01 - Who's That Pokemon?

Catch it [right here](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/GwYLRw).

A simple application to play a simple game. Inspired by the pokemon anime. Using the following:

- styled-components;

- react spring;

- a public API (which seems to currently not work as expected).

### 02 - FreeCodeCamp Podcast App

Always updating [right here](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/yGbpMm).

A mobile-friendly application to play podcast episodes from the freeCodeCamp RSS feed. Practicing with:

- styled-components;

- RSS Feed.

Can be definitely improved, but as a proof of concept it works wonders.

### 03 - React SVG Watch

Ticking [right here](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/ebRVJd).

An analog watch, highlighting the current time with a few vector-based niceties. Leveraging:

- SVG syntax.

### 04 - React Timer

Counting down [right here](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/dwVZRQ).

A two-steps application to start a timer with style. Making use of:

- styled-components;

- react-spring.
