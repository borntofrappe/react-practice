# React Practice

## TODO

- [ ] revisit project **#01 - Who's That Pokemon** to cover the existing bug

## Preface

Inspired by many, but mostly [codevember](http://codevember.xyz/) and Wes Bos's course [javascript 30](https://javascript30.com/), I set out to create 30 applications with React.js. 31 for good measure.

Each application will be saved in a separate folder of this very own repository. Upon completing the last project of the lot, I will update the grid-based layout referenced in the **React Practice Container** folder, showcasing each one of them.

## Projects

### Reactice Container

Cased [right here](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/NELLxG/).

A stylish container in which to reference every single future react-based project which is part of #reactice. While technically not one of the projects that fall under the "React Practice" label, it is a good excuse to practice with React, Styled Components and React Router.

### 01 - Who's That Pokemon?

Catch it [right here](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/GwYLRw).

A simple application to play a simple game inspired by the pokemon anime. Using the following:

- styled-components;

- react spring;

- a public API.

Update: there seems to be an issue with the public API. This warrants further investigation. See TODOs above.

### 02 - FreeCodeCamp Podcast App

Always updating [right here](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/yGbpMm).

A mobile-friendly application to play podcast episodes from the freeCodeCamp RSS feed. Practicing with:

- styled-components;

- RSS Feed.

Can be definitely improved, but as a proof of concept it works wonders.

### 03 - React SVGatch

Ticking [right here](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/ebRVJd).

An analog watch highlighting the current time with a few vector-based niceties. Leveraging:

- SVG syntax.

### 04 - Timer App

Counting down [right here](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/dwVZRQ).

A two-steps application to start a timer with style. Making use of:

- styled-components;

- react-spring.


### 05 - Double Slider Form

Sliding and gliding [right here](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/OGyJbm).

An incredibly popular design replicated with React, to allow visitors to alternatively sign in or sign up to an hypothetical application.

### 06 - F1 Quiz

Testing trivia [right here](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/pBeMzz).

Replicating the quiz proposed on the official F1 website every racing week.
