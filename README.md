# React Practice

## Preface

Inspired by [codevember](http://codevember.xyz/), I set out to replicate the grid of 30 items. This with a single purpose in mind: create 30 applications with React.js. 31 for good measure.

Each application will be saved in a separate folder of this very own repository. Predictably, each application will also be included, cased in the grid-based layout provided by the very first project. This one will be used akin to an advent calendar, and will likely motivate me enough to build something. And then something else, for thirty more times.
