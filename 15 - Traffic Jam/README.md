# Traffic Jam

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/YzPNRjR)

## Goal

Highlight the change in traffic with a bar chart and a linear gradient.

## Notes

The project was inspired by a visualization [described in this article @lemondefr](https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2019/12/16/ile-de-france-entre-25-et-100-de-bouchons-en-plus-depuis-le-debut-de-la-greve_6023037_4355770.html), and it was a good opportunity to practice with hooks to create an informative, even if slightly boring, visualization.
