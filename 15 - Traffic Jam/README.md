# Traffic Jam

## [Bar Chart](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/YzPNRjR)

<!-- ## [SVG Illustration]() -->

## Goal

Highlight the change in traffic with two visualization: a bar chart and an SVG illustration.

## Notes

The project was inspired by [this article @lemondefr](https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2019/12/16/ile-de-france-entre-25-et-100-de-bouchons-en-plus-depuis-le-debut-de-la-greve_6023037_4355770.html), and it was a good opportunity to practice with hooks and d3.

At first, I recreated the bar chart showcased in the article, in an informative, albeit dull visualization. The inclusion of the tooltip proved to be quite challenging, and at first buggy, but the experience I've gained using D3 with React, and the discovery of `d3.ticks`, made the project more than useful.

With the second project, I decided to use the data with an SVG illustration, and change the appearance of the graphic in a more striking visualization.
