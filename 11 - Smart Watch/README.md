# Smart Watch

## Goal

Create a series of independent applications for a hypothetical smart watch.

## Notes

This project is inspired by the portable device from a few titles of the Pokemon game series.

The actual device has several gadgets, but Iâ€™d like to focus on the following:

-   digital watch

-   calculator

-   memo pad

-   counter

-   analog watch

I plan to develop these five applications, but the beauty of using a component-based approach means that the watch is ultimately expand-able, and adding a new feature is a matter of adding a dedicated component.

## UI

In the **res** folder you find the markup and stylesheet recreating the design of the smart watch from the Pokemon series. I'd like to include a more entertaining background, perhaps with a repeating pattern and SVG syntax in a future update.
