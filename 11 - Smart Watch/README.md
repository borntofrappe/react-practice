# Smart Watch

## Goal

Create a series of independent applications for a hypothetical smart watch.

## Notes

This project is inspired by the portable device from a few titles of the Pokemon game series.

The actual device has several gadgets, but Iâ€™d like to focus on the following:

-   digital watch

-   calculator

-   counter

-   analog watch

I plan to develop these five applications, but the beauty of using a component-based approach means that the watch is ultimately expand-able, and adding a new feature is a matter of adding a dedicated component.

## Design

In the **res** folder you find the markup and stylesheet developed for each independent application. I spent a considerable amount of time creating the desired appearance with SVG syntax.

## Development

It is worth mentioning that I'm developing the same concept with Svelte. For reference, you can find the source code [here](https://github.com/borntofrappe/svelte-tutorial/tree/master/Smart%20Watch).
