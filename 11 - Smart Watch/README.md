# [Smart Watch](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/KKKqzJa)

## Goal

Create a series of independent applications for a hypothetical smart watch.

## Notes

This project is inspired by the portable device from a few titles of the Pokemon game series.

The actual device has several gadgets, but Iâ€™d like to focus on the following:

-   [x] digital watch

-   calculator

-   [x] counter

-   [x] analog watch

I plan to develop these five applications, but the beauty of using a component-based approach means that the watch is ultimately expand-able, and adding a new feature is a matter of adding a dedicated component.

## Design

In the **res** folder you find the markup and stylesheet developed for each independent application. I spent a considerable amount of time creating the desired appearance with SVG syntax.

## Development

It is worth mentioning that I'm developing the same concept with Svelte. For reference, you can find the source code [here](https://github.com/borntofrappe/svelte-tutorial/tree/master/Smart%20Watch).

## Reading List

While researching hooks and how to implement the desired functionality, I came upon two articles worth a thorough read:

-   [https://overreacted.io/a-complete-guide-to-useeffect/](https://overreacted.io/a-complete-guide-to-useeffect/)

-   [Making setInterval Declarative with React Hooks](https://overreacted.io/making-setinterval-declarative-with-react-hooks/)
