# [Concentration](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/rNNWGMZ)

## Goal

Create a memory-based game in which cards are flipped and matched in pairs.

## Notes

This project is parallel to the same concept developed with the Svelte framework. You can find the project [in this repo](https://github.com/borntofrappe/svelte-tutorial/tree/master/Concentration) or live [on CodePen](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/yLLVNME).

In the **res** folder you find the design of the individual card. This is meant to replicate the design already developed for the svelte counterpart, only with a logo and color palette more appropriate for the react framework.
