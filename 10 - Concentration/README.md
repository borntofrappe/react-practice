# Concentration

## Goal

Create a memory-based game in which cards are flipped and matched in pairs.

## Notes

This project is parallel to the same concept developed with the Svelte framework. You can find the project [in this repo](https://github.com/borntofrappe/svelte-tutorial/tree/master/Concentration) or live [on CodePen](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/yLLVNME).
