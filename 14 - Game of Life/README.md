# Game of Life

## Goal

Create the basic structure behind the game of life with the canvas API.

## Notes

Previously, I developed the skeleton of the game of life with vanilla JavaScript. While describing the behavior of the cells however, I thought React would be the best fit to update the application based on its previous state.

In the **res** folder you find this first effort.
