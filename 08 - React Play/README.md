# React Play

## Goal

Recreate the interactive carousel as highlighted in the [F1 Play gaming website](https://www.formula1.com/en/gaming/f1-play.html).

## Development

### UI

While the project is meant to be a React application, it is first designed with HTML markup and a single CSS stylesheet. The UI doesn't recreate the entirety of the carousel, but only of a card in said carousel. Given the predominance of the component however, I though it best to dedicate a coding session to the layout and style of the element.

You can find the UI in the dedicated subfolder of this repo, or online [@codepen](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/ZdbeJw).
