# React Play

## [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/dBpVbB)

## Goal

Recreate the interactive carousel as highlighted on the [F1 gaming website](https://www.formula1.com/en/gaming/f1-play.html).

## Notes

The project wasn't developed in a single coding session, but is instead the result of a multiple day's effort.

At first, I developed the UI of a single card in the carousel. You can find a reference [right here on codepen](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/ZdbeJw) or in the UI subfolder.

Following this design-heavy effort, I developed the application through the React framework. The application is broken down in multiple components, and each smaller component is then styled through the `styled-components` library. You can find the application in the **React App** folder, or at the [referenced URL](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/dBpVbB).

## Future Notes

The project allowed me to practice with React, styled-components and vanilla JavaScript to massage the data in the desired format. That being said, the application leverages a class component in `App.js`. At a later stage I'd like to refactor the application and use **hooks** instead, leveraging functional components instead.
